#LIST EXERCISES

#1
oddlist = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]
#Did oddlist become a variable?
    #Yes, oddlist became a variable since the integers were assigned to it. 
    #The print function can be used to print oddlist and the output is the 
    #integers that were assigned to oddlist initally. Also, in the variable 
    #explorer, oddlist appeared as a variable and the type is 'list'.
    
#2
print (oddlist)

#3
print(len(oddlist))
#How long does python say the list is?
    #The output of this is 5. This indicates that the list has 5 items in it.
    
#4
print(type(oddlist))
#What type of variable does python say oddlist is?
    #Output shows that this is a list variable.
    
#5/6
intlist = list(range(1,100))
print(intlist)
#Does it list all integers between 0 and 100?
    #This prints out integers 1 to 99, which are all the integers betweeen 0 and 100.
    #in other words, yes, it does list all the integers between 0 and 100.
